Continous integration is the process in which developers commit code to the repository reguraly (each day).


The stages of a pipeline:
1. Developers - commit code in the version control (github, bitbucket, etc.)
2. The code is compiled/built and gives feedback for the unit tests, written by the devs.
3. Automated acceptance tests.
4. User acceptance tests - end users test the software.
5. Deploy/Release - the code is in production environment.
